I wanted to take a moment to write a post that I've been thinking about for a while. If you follow my work, you've likely noticed that I haven't been around as much lately. I believe in being transparent with the community, so I wanted to explain where I'm at and what this means for my projects.

The unfortunate reality is that I simply don't have the time to contribute at this current time (and in the foreseeable future). I've loved working in the open source space, but right now, I simply don't have the capacity to maintain my projects at the level they deserve.

**These projects are hereon effectively <u>_unmaintained_</u>.**

I know this directly affects my two biggest projects:

- [Celeste](https://github.com/hwittenborn/celeste)
- [makedeb](https://makedeb.org) (see [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/) as an alternative).

To everyone who uses these tools or has contributed to them: **_thank you_**. I know that a lack of active maintenance can be frustrating, and I want to be honest that I won't be able to give them the attention they need.

This shift is happening because I am dedicating my full focus to building my new company, [**Riff Labs**](https://rifflabs.io). It's an exciting new venture for me, but it also demands all of my time and energy.

I want to emphasize that I still believe in the power of open source. It’s an incredible ecosystem, and I have nothing but respect for the community. However, I’ve had to make the tough decision that it isn’t the right path for me right now to stay involved with these projects. It wasn't an easy choice, but it's one I had to make to fully commit to my new direction.

I may return to open source one day, though I don't picture that happening soon.

Thank you all for the support, feedback, and code you've shared with me over the years. It has meant a lot.
